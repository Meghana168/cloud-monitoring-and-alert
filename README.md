This task is based on cloud watch and EC2 instance were we create instance in ec2 option and copy the instance id were it is used to create alarms in cloud watch, cloud watch is a function in aws where it monitors the instance for every period of time we set manually. It can be setted manually by the user for 2 minutes,5 minutes, 10 minutes or inbuild time wt the user needed. The user cant watch the instance continously so he uses the cloud watch to monitor the instance,it indicates us by alarms on cloud watch when the alaram alerts us the instance automatically moves from running state to stopped state without any instructions.we can view the changes of instance in the cloud watch in the garph metrics form and ec2 dashboard view. SNS- simple notification service is used to create alarm which indiactes the changes in instance by notifiactions to the user. The main advantage of this cloud monitoring and alerts is to monitor the ec2 instance and maintain it
